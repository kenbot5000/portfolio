      I'm an experienced fullstack web dev with over 5 years of development experience under my belt. I primarily work with the MEVN stack (though AWS is mostly used in my current project), but most experienced in front-end development using Vue. Most of my work is done as a developer for Winona, a medical company where I developed several projects from scratch, which are used by the various members of the company.

      As for other tools that I use for creating projects: I've used Express.js for backend work, and have used Figma to create designs. I use Python, as well as different game engines to make small games and tools. I've also created small Discord chat bots using Python in the past. I like to dabble in development skills beyond web, and I'm always willing to learn something new to pull off a project.

      In my free time, I like to play video games and cosplay :) I also own a cat and a dog!
